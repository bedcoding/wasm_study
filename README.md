Q. I don't know what that file is. (vendor > package-1.0.1.tgz) <br />
How did you make it?

A. Contains the dependencies required for the imported files (tflite).
I vendor it from the virtual background repository. 
In fact, you can now import any code from their repository and it will work flawlessly.

Eslint errors are not code errors. 
They are simply errors indicating that the method of your code is not correct. 
You should take a different approach. 
Because the tflite code isn't mine, I'm not responsible for fixing it.
That's why I included a rule in the package.
json to override the eslint rules for these two files.
